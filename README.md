# Marquette Historic District Virtual Tour

A Rails 8 web application providing an interactive virtual tour of the historic homes and landmarks in the Marquette Historic District of Kewaunee, Wisconsin.

## About the Marquette Historic District

The Marquette Historic District is a charming neighborhood in Kewaunee, Wisconsin, that preserves the architectural heritage and cultural history of this Lake Michigan coastal community. Named after Father Jacques Marquette, the French missionary and explorer who traveled through the region in the 17th century, this district showcases beautiful examples of late 19th and early 20th century residential architecture.

The district features a diverse collection of historic homes representing various architectural styles including Victorian, Prairie School, and Craftsman designs. These well-preserved structures tell the story of Kewaunee's development from a lumber and fishing community to a thriving lakeside town, reflecting the lives of the immigrant families—many of Czech, German, and Polish heritage—who built and inhabited these homes.
