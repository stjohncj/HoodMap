- Picture of my house is too dark

- Should I photograph all or perhaps the remaining the houses on a nice day?
  - Should I try to get assistance from someone?
- Do we need to center and trim house photos provided manually?
- Map
  - Center picture vertically in site detail modal that displays over map.


- *** - MHD Architecture page, should we choose particalur pictures based on the text? Rather than random selection - yes!
  - Rewrite MHD Architecture page's "While the house has a compact massing, the irregularity of the style is seen in the multi-gable and hipped roofline, the projecting gable sections, the second and third story bay on the north wall, the irregular windows, and the overall asymmetrical plan of the house."
    - In architecture, compact massing describes a building's three-dimensional form when its various volumes are tightly arranged around a central shape, creating a dense, unified, and often solid-looking structure. This arrangement is chosen to efficiently utilize space and energy, contributing to sustainability by maximizing passive heating and cooling and optimizing natural light, while also influencing the building's aesthetic character and how it interacts with its environment.
  - MHD Architecture - Look into the tone used when describing smaller houses
    - 1205 Dodge - Anton Kieweg  - "diminutive" "cottage"?
    - 822 Dodge - "a much smaller house" - why "much"
    - 1018 Dodge - this is a good example for describing a smaller site
  - Look at the original MHD book to see if it lists the authors

- "About the Marquette Historic District" blurb should give a little more history on the school within the text, after it mentions the school. Operating dates, name changes, vacancies, etc.

- DISTRICT BACKGROUND
     - "Beginning with prominent merchant and pioneer Joseph Duvall, who built the first large house, an Italianate mansion, in the district; and lumber magnate and State Senator George Grimmer, who followed with a Queen Anne house that set the tone for homes soon to follow in the district, many prominent families quickly built showplace homes along Dodge and Milwaukee Streets."

- Can we should we link the pictures within MHD Architecture page to a site detail (modal or otherwise?)
  - Could potentially link to the map page with the house selected?
  - We should make all selection states within the map and gallery pages linkable
    - need to save state for selections or is it already available acceptably from DOM traversal etc?
    - gallery, site modal, and anywhere else?
